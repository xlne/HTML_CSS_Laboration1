                    These variants are the ‘perfect’ bananas for many. This sweeter, softer yellow banana
                    is easier to digest as the resistant starch changes into simple sugar. They contain
                    more antioxidants when compared to the green ones, as bananas have a higher level of
                    antioxidants as they ripen. But the higher glycemic index makes the yellow variant
                    something Type 2 Diabetes patients need to avoid.

                    Red bananas are a group of varieties of banana with reddish skin.
                    Some are smaller and plumper than the common Cavendish banana, others much
                    larger. When ripe, raw red bananas have a flesh that is cream to light pink
                    in color. They are also softer and sweeter than the yellow Cavendish varieties,
                    some with a slight raspberry flavor and others with an earthy one. Many
                    red bananas are exported by producers in East Africa, Asia, South America
                    and the United Arab Emirates. They are a favorite in Central America as a
                    form of aphrodisiac juice, along with being a favourite in India in order
                    to promote fertility but are sold throughout the world.

                    Red bananas (Red Dacca) refer to a classification of banana cultivars that
                    have red skin with creamy pink flesh. In general, red banana cultivars are
                    smaller, sweeter and softer than Cavendish bananas. However, some types of
                    red bananas can be larger than traditional bananas. Usually, red varieties
                    of bananas are classified by the region where they grow. For example, there
                    are Red Spanish, Red Cuban, or Red Colorado bananas. One thing these red
                    bananas have in common is their deliciously sweet taste. There is also a
                    type of Red Cavendish banana. If you find where to buy red bananas, make
                    sure and wait until they are ripe before eating them. Unripe red bananas
                    tend to have an unpalatable chalky texture and taste. When they are ripe,
                    their peel turns reddish-purple skin. Peeling the skin reveals a light
                    creamy flesh that is semi-soft. Some types of red bananas have yellowish-orange
                    flesh. The sweet flesh has hints of bananas and raspberries when you bite into it.
                    You can eat red bananas raw similar to yellow Cavendish bananas. You can also
                    bake them or toast them to create a delicious hot sweet dessert. As with most
                    bananas, red bananas are also a good source of nutrients. However, compared to
                    yellow varieties, red bananas have more beta carotene and vitamin C. The deeper
                    the orange/red color, the more B-carotene is in the flesh. Some people claim
                    that these ‘alternative’ red banana cultivars are the healthiest type of bananas
                    you can buy. In fact, some studies have suggested that eating orange-fleshed
                    red bananas could be a good way to prevent vitamin A deficiencies.

                    Blue Bananas are a type of banana with a taste and texture that is reminiscent of
                    vanilla ice cream. In addition to their interesting flavor, they stand out for the
                    bright blue hue of their peel and their creamy white flesh. Though they’re not as
                    well known as Cavendish bananas, which are the bananas you may normally find at the
                    grocery store, blue Java bananas are widely grown in Southeast Asia and enjoyed
                    as a delicious, all-natural dessert. This article looks at blue Java bananas,
                    why they’re often compared to ice cream, and whether they’re good for your health.
                    They’re a hybrid of two species of banana native to Southeast Asia — Musa balbisiana
                    and Musa acuminata. Before they’re fully ripe, they have an unusual blue-tinged peel
                    due to their natural wax coating. This tends to slowly fade as they mature. They also
                    have a longer, stouter appearance than other banana varieties, with white flesh and
                    small black seeds

                    When bananas are green in colour, be assured that they are full of high
                    resistant starch. If you are watching your diet and trying to avoid food
                    high in sugar content, green bananas might be one of the healthiest food
                    options for you. They might taste bitter as they contain less sugar.
                    These unripe bananas also contain probiotic bacteria which is good for
                    your digestive system and are also perfect for cooking. Do keep in mind
                    that this green variant might cause bloating and make you feel gassy.

                This was a school project where we made a website with HTML and CSS.
                It was an intense time where we learned a lot and made us realize that
                our choice to become .Net-developer was the right one. Design and front-end
                was just not for us. Maybe one day, but not today. We stayed strong.
